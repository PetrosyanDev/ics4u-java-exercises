         * Expression & Assignment Worksheet for Java
         * 1. A variable is a named memory location that holds a value of a declared
         * type.
         * 2. An identifier is the programmer-defined name used for classes, methods,
         * variables, etc., following Java's naming rules.
         * 3. A variable can store one value of its type at a time.
         * 4. A constant is a named value whose contents cannot change after it is
         * assigned (e.g., a final variable).
         * 5. An expression is a combination of literals, variables, and operators that
         * evaluates to a single value.
         * 6. byte (1 byte), short (2 bytes), int (4 bytes), long (8 bytes).
         * 7. float (4 bytes), double (8 bytes).
         * 8. An escape sequence is a backslash character pair that represents a special
         * character in a string or char literal.
         * 9. Operator precedence is the rule set that decides the order in which
         * different operators are evaluated.
         * 10. Widening conversions are safer because the destination type can represent
         * all values of the source type without loss.
         * 11. The new operator allocates memory for an object and returns a reference
         * to it after running the constructor.
         * 12. With w = 2, y = 7, z = 12 evaluated per expression:
         * a) 24
         * b) 31
         * c) -24
         * d) 29 (z is decremented before use; y is incremented after use)
         * e) 32 (z is used before post-decrement; y is incremented before use)
         * f) 86
         * g) 7
         * h) 108
         * i) 3 (integer division)
         * j) 0 (integer division)
         * k) 2
         * l) 1
         * 13. With double w = 12.9, y = 3.2, z = 12.2:
         * a) ≈ 1.057
         * b) ≈ 0.946
         * c) ≈ -2.143
         * d) -26.14
         * e) ≈ 2.24
         * f) ≈ 0.296
         * g) ≈ 49.181
         * h) 3.2
         * 14. With w = 5, y = 9, z = 2 evaluated per assignment:
         * a) z = 45
         * b) z = 11
         * c) y = 4 (integer division)
         * d) y = 1
         * e) y = 19
         * f) y = 16
         * 15. With char a = 'a', b = 'B'; String s = "This is fun."; int e;
         * a) a = a
         * b) a = a
         * c) 163 (character codes added)
         * d) This is fun.
         * e) 12
         * 16. Algebraic equations were not provided in the prompt, so conversions to
         * Java cannot be completed without them.
